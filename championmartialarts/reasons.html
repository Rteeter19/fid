    <h2>Doing martial arts offers many benefits, a couple examples of them are..</h2>
   
  </header>
<p this summer we are proud to announce that we are offerring summmer camps,intermediate, and advanced level classes</p>

  <section id="1.increased confidence">
    <h3>increased confidence</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>increased confidence</dt>
      <dd>Increased confidence is something that martial artists of all ages enjoy. Whether it's for you or your child, martial arts can help you improve your confidence. Practicing, improving, and succeeding at a skill improves self-image and gives participants confidence that they can succeed in other areas and ventures. </span></dd>


      <dt class="newitem">
      <h2>2.full body workout</h2>
      Are you looking for a new form of exercise?
      Martial arts is your answer.
That's because martial arts truly provide a full body workout. The consistent practice has shown to increase overall mobility, improve your body's pressure response, and increase muscle.

Because so many martial arts involve repeat muscular actions over time you'll build strength and burn fat. Who doesn't want that?

Looking for a way to increase strength and build muscle quickly and intensely? Kempo can do it for you. It’s a full-body martial art that combines the athletic abilities of Karate, Judo, Kung-Fu, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. This is an ideal martial arts system to accomplish those goals. &#8212; <strong>new item!</strong></dt>
      <dd>The sign up fee for Summer camps will be $24.99 for each child aklready a member of our studio, the fee for non-members will be $29.99</span></dd>

  <section id="3.increased flexibility">
    <h3>increased flexibility</h3>
    <dl>
      <dt>increased flexibility</dt>
      <dd> Repetitive movements like high kicks, low stances, fancy footwork, and ground maneuvering improve flexibility and mobility which will benefit your overall health.

Did you know that flexibility has many health benefits? Some of them include:

Improved posture

Better freedom of movement

Reduced muscle soreness and tension

Improved relaxation of mind and body

Reduced risk of injury </span></dd>

      <dt class="newitem">4.Better coordination &#8212; <strong>new item!</strong></dt>
      <dd>All martial arts require spacial awareness and coordinating movement with another person. Some martial arts even include the use of props and tools.

All of these factors improve the coordination and awareness of the participant's body as well as the people and objects around them.

Practices like Kempo encourage the lower part of the body to act as a base from which the upper body can maneuver and operate – this idea has been borrowed by many martial art systems including Krav Maga.   </span></dd>

    <h2>self defense skills</h2>
    <p>posted by champion martial arts, <time datetime="2021-4-7">April 7, 2021</time></p>
  </header>
  <p>One obvious benefit to learning martial arts is an improved ability to perform self-defense maneuvers in situations where there is a real threat.

According to recent data, an aggravated assault occurs every 43 seconds in the United States. Martial arts can prepare practitioners to defend themselves in life-threatening and dangerous situations.

This is great for you but also really great for your children as well</p>

  <p> We Hope you find one of these Reasons appealing to you, and would love to see you became a part of our martial arts family! </p>
